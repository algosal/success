          It is the knowledge of Perfect Law working through and above all things; 
            of perfect justice operating in and adjusting all human affairs, 
            that enables the good man to love his enemies, 
            and to rise above all hatred, resentment or complaining; 
            for he knows that only his own can come to him, and that 
            though he be surrounded by persecutors, his enemies are but the 
            blind instruments of a faultless retribution; and so he blames them not, 
            and calmly receives his accounts and patiently pays his moral debt. </p>
